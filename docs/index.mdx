# Getting Started

fielded is a library for managing form state on the web or Node.js.
Its main features are

- **Strongly typed with TypeScript**.<br/>
  All properties are statically referenced.
  There are no fragile strings that you need to remember to update when doing refactors like in
  similar form state libraries.
- **Independent of UI**.<br/>
  fielded may be used with React, plain HTML, or even in a Node.js server! This makes your forms
  testable, decoupled and portable.
- **Simple semantics**.<br/>
  Since fielded's constructs are plain JavaScript classes and functions, it's easy to test validation
  behaviours, or even extend it to generate UI from the form state.

## Prerequisites

fielded is _currently_ powered by [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/), a reactivity-based state management library.<br/>
You'll need to install it and observe fielded's state using its APIs (e.g. computeds, observers) to be notified of changes.

:::note

This dependency will soon be removed to support applications that don't use it.

## Installation

You can get fielded by using your favourite package manager:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npm">

    npm install fielded

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn">

    yarn add fielded

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Example

As mentioned above, fielded makes use of pure JavaScript, powered by MobX observers.
The following example demonstrates how to update the form state and track its changes:

```js
import { Form, FormArray, Field } from "fielded";
import { autorun } from "mobx";

const form = new Form({
  name: Field.text("John Doe"),
  age: Field.number(),
  pets: new FormArray([new Form({ name: Field.text("Rex") })]),
});

autorun(() => {
  console.log(form.snapshot());
});
// logs { name: 'John Doe', pets: [{ name: 'Rex' }] }

form.fields.age.set(30);
// logs { name: 'John Doe', age: 30, pets: [{ name: 'Rex' }] }
```

Now, let's understand how to use fielded's APIs to build your form state.
